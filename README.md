# quizChallenge
 This repo is for the code-quiz-challenge, this project has been quite the challenge indeed for me personally,
but I would have to say that I've learn quite a few important things in the process. One of the most important
skills that saw some improvement was the github piece. prior to this project I was really have alot of merge conflict type issues. I've since learned to use my desktop and vs code to create the local repo. Small but critical steps. I probably wrote this quiz out at least ten times. On a couple of those attempts I was closer than I realized, only to get frustrated and errase the work. I participated in a study group with Savannah Williams, Ricardo Torres and Maryna Serdeshna. They had been able to schedule some tutor time which they said had helped. After sharing our projects I gained some understanding in relation to a promblem I was having getting the separate screens to load independently. Some were using their buttons as anchor tags which was good and also worked for me at one point. Savannah was also using more than one html file which I could see was working good. Most of what I have now I modeled after a project on GeeksforGeeks.org that was similar. I have a 
tutor scheduled for tomorrow at noon and hopefully I can get this working better than it is now. I also found some useful css styling info that I used from csstricks.com.
